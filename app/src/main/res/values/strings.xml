    <string name="welcome_text" formatted="false">BlabberTabber allows you to record how much time each
        speaker has spoken in a meeting.  It is currently in ALPHA test, and does NOT produce meaningful
        results.\n
        \nTo pause, press "PAUSE", to resume, press
        "RECORD", and to reset the tally, press "RESET".\n
        \nWhen the meeting is over, press finish to see the final tally. You will have the option
        to email or SMS the results.\n
        \nBlabberTabber IS WRONG 100% OF THE TIME. We are working to fix it.\n
        \nPlease do not review BlabberTabber at this time.  (Unless, of course, you want to give us
        five stars to encourage us to finish it.)

    <string name="acknowledgements_text" formatted="false">
        Charlotte Cunningham designed BlabberTabber and also created all graphics.\n
        \nBlabberTabber was written by Brendan Cunnie and Brian Cunnie.\n
        \nDaniel Di Matteo wrote the first android diarization program. His code
        helped us tremendously, and uses LIUM.\n
        \nLIUM is a Java-based open source toolkit for diarization, written by
        Sylvain Meignier, Gregor Dupuy, Paul Gay, and others. It uses Sphinx.\n
        \nCMU Sphinx is open source toolkit for speech recognition.\n
        \nGerald Friedland, Ph.D. and Ekaterina Gonina, Ph.D. advised us and
        published the research papers which inspired us to write BlabberTabber.
