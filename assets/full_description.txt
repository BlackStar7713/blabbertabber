Be considerate: when recording a meeting, make sure you have the consent of everyone at the meeting. If you don't, you may be breaking the law.

BlabberTabber is a work-in-progress! Let us know if you find bugs https://github.com/blabbertabber/blabbertabber/issues/

BlabberTabber is an app that aspires to perform speaker diarization; it answers the question, "who spoke when?".

BlabberTabber, when started, will record the meeting (via your Android device's microphone). When the meeting is over, pause the recording, press "Finish", and then be sent to a web page with the results.
